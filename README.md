👋 Hi there, I'm Damian Szymanek!

🎓 I'm a 3rd year IT student at Czestochowa University of Technology and the proud leader of the PCz Rover Team. We're a passionate group of scientists building Martian rovers for the University Rover Challenge. 🚀

🏆 This year, we achieved an impressive 11th place out of 104 teams from all around the world! 🌍

💻 I'm a programmer with experience in C++, Python, and JavaScript. I've developed a control panel for our Martian rover, which we used to control the entire rover in this year's competition.

👨‍💼 As a leader, I believe in leading from the front and working closely with my team members. I'm also a confident speaker and excel at teamwork, organization, micromanagement, and building relationships with firms for sponsorship and barter agreements.

🔭 Feel free to check out my repositories to see some of the projects I've worked on. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to get in touch!
